        My own sandbox to test different web related things. In this case using
        React as the main frontend framework (because I just love making
        components) and the amazing <b>styled-components</b> library to provide
        the styling (no CSS files around here, folks!).
      </p>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}

export default Home;
